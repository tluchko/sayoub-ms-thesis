  abstract = {Abstract             Mammalian sensory systems detect sweet taste through the activation of a single heteromeric T1R2/T1R3 receptor belonging to class C G-protein-coupled receptors. Allosteric ligands are known to interact within the transmembrane domain, yet a complete view of receptor activation remains elusive. By combining site-directed mutagenesis with computational modeling, we investigate the structure and dynamics of the allosteric binding pocket of the T1R3 sweet-taste receptor in its apo form, and in the presence of an allosteric ligand, cyclamate. A novel positively charged residue at the extracellular loop 2 is shown to interact with the ligand. Molecular dynamics simulations capture significant differences in the behavior of a network of conserved residues with and without cyclamate, although they do not directly interact with the allosteric ligand. Structural models show that they adopt alternate conformations, associated with a conformational change in the transmembrane region. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms that these residues are unequivocally involved in the receptor function and the allosteric signaling mechanism of the sweet-taste receptor. Similar to a large portion of the transmembrane domain, they are highly conserved among mammals, suggesting an activation mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved. This work provides a structural basis for describing the dynamics of the receptor, and for the rational design of new sweet-taste modulators.},

  abstract = {Recent calorimetric studies of interactions between small molecules and biomolecular targets have generated renewed interest in the phenomenon of entropy-enthalpy compensation. In these studies, entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding are observed to vary substantially and in an opposing manner as the ligand or protein is modified, whereas the binding free energy varies little. In severe examples, engineered enthalpic gains can lead to completely compensating entropic penalties, frustrating ligand design. Here, we examine the evidence for compensation, as well as its potential origins, prevalence, severity, and ramifications for ligand engineering. We find the evidence for severe compensation to be weak in light of the large magnitude of and correlation between errors in experimental measurements of entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding, though a limited form of compensation may be common. Given the difficulty of predicting or measuring entropic and enthalpic changes to useful precision, or using this information in design, we recommend ligand engineering efforts instead focus on computational and experimental methodologies to directly assess changes in binding free energy.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Within the past decade, clinical microbiology laboratories experienced revolutionary changes in the way in which microorganisms are identified, moving away from slow, traditional microbial identification algorithms toward rapid molecular methods and mass spectrometry (MS). Historically, MS was clinically utilized as a high-complexity method adapted for protein-centered analysis of samples in chemistry and hematology laboratories. Today, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS is adapted for use in microbiology laboratories, where it serves as a paradigm-shifting, rapid, and robust method for accurate microbial identification. Multiple instrument platforms, marketed by well-established manufacturers, are beginning to displace automated phenotypic identification instruments and in some cases genetic sequence-based identification practices. This review summarizes the current position of MALDI-TOF MS in clinical research and in diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratories and serves as a primer to examine the “nuts and bolts” of MALDI-TOF MS, highlighting research associated with sample preparation, spectral analysis, and accuracy. Currently available MALDI-TOF MS hardware and software platforms that support the use of MALDI-TOF with direct and precultured specimens and integration of the technology into the laboratory workflow are also discussed. Finally, this review closes with a prospective view of the future of MALDI-TOF MS in the clinical microbiology laboratory to accelerate diagnosis and microbial identification to improve patient care.},

  abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein–ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

For this purpose, it became necessary to represent molecules in a syntax that would be readable by computers and understandable by scientists of various fields. A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. We present here some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in drug discovery, many of which are based on graph representations. Furthermore, we describe applications of these representations in AI-driven drug discovery. Our aim is to provide a brief guide on structural representations that are essential to the practice of AI in drug discovery. This review serves as a guide for researchers who have little experience with the handling of chemical representations and plan to work on applications at the interface of these fields.},

  abstract = {Graphene quantum dots with unique properties have great potential applications for biosensing and bioimaging.           ,              Fluorescent carbon-based nanomaterials, including carbon dots (C-Dots) and the emerging graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are attracting increasing interest in the field of biosensing and bioimaging for their high aqueous solubility, stable photoluminescence (PL), low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility as well as superior resistance to photobleaching. Compared with C-Dots, the quasi zero-dimensional (0D) GQDs with a few atomic layers can exhibit strong PL without passivation. With these extraordinary properties, GQDs are suitable alternatives as both a versatile platform for biosensing and a promising class of bioimaging probes. In this review, we introduce the synthesis, structure, PL properties and currently available applications of GQDs in biosensing and bioimaging field. We hope this review will provide critical insights to inspire more exciting researches on GQDs for biological applications to better realize the potential of the intriguing GQDs in the near future.},

The absorption spectra and HOMO–LUMO gaps are quantitatively analyzed to study the correlations between the optical properties and heteroatom doping of doped GQDs. Heteroatom doping can endow GQDs with various new optical and structural properties, depending on the dopants and doping configurations. Compared with the absorption spectra of pristine GQD, both N and S surface doping demonstrate a slight blue shift, whereas B and P doping lead to a blue shift for edge-doped GQDs with heteroatoms in a pentatomic ring. The absorption process is investigated along with excited state analysis, which includes the density of state, natural transition orbital, and charge difference density. The results indicate that large radius atoms assist charge transfer in the excited state and play an important role in recombining the electron density distribution in the doped GQDs.},

Here, we present the solution structure of a signal peptide bound to SecA, the 204 kDa ATPase motor of the Sec translocase. Upon encounter, the signal peptide forms an alpha-helix that inserts into a flexible and elongated groove in SecA. The mode of binding is bimodal, with both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions mediating recognition. The same groove is used by SecA to recognize a diverse set of signal sequences. Impairment of the signal-peptide binding to SecA results in significant translocation defects. The C-terminal tail of SecA occludes the groove and inhibits signal-peptide binding, but autoinhibition is relieved by the SecB chaperone. Finally, it is shown that SecA interconverts between two conformations in solution, suggesting a simple mechanism for polypeptide translocation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Absolute binding free energy calculations with explicit solvent molecular simulations can provide estimates of protein-ligand affinities, and thus reduce the time and costs needed to find new drug candidates. However, these calculations can be complex to implement and perform. Here, we introduce the software BAT.py, a Python tool that invokes the AMBER simulation package to automate the calculation of binding free energies for a protein with a series of ligands. The software supports the attach-pull-release (APR) and double decoupling (DD) binding free energy methods, as well as the simultaneous decoupling-recoupling (SDR) method, a variant of double decoupling that avoids numerical artifacts associated with charged ligands. We report encouraging initial test applications of this software both to re-rank docked poses and to estimate overall binding free energies. We also show that it is practical to carry out these calculations cheaply by using graphical processing units in common machines that can be built for this purpose. The combination of automation and low cost positions this procedure to be applied in a relatively high-throughput mode and thus stands to enable new applications in early-stage drug discovery.},

ABT-538 exhibited potent in vitro activity against laboratory and clinical strains of HIV-1 [50\% effective concentration (EC50) = 0.022-0.13 microM] and HIV-2 (EC50 = 0.16 microM). Following a single 10-mg/kg oral dose, plasma concentrations in rat, dog, and monkey exceeded the in vitro antiviral EC50 for {$>$} 12 h. In human trials, a single 400-mg dose of ABT-538 displayed a prolonged absorption profile and achieved a peak plasma concentration in excess of 5 micrograms/ml. These findings demonstrate that high oral bioavailability can be achieved in humans with peptidomimetic inhibitors of HIV protease.},

  abstract = {The sweet taste in humans is mediated by the TAS1R2/TAS1R3 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which belongs to the class C family that also includes the metabotropic glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid receptors. We report here the predicted 3D structure of the full-length TAS1R2/TAS1R3 heterodimer, including the Venus Flytrap Domains (VFDs) [in the closed–open (co) active conformation], the cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), and the transmembrane domains (TMDs) at the TM56/TM56 interface. We observe that binding of agonists to VFD2 of TAS1R2 leads to major conformational changes to form a TM6/TM6 interface between TMDs of TAS1R2 and TAS1R3, which is consistent with the activation process observed biophysically on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 homodimer. We find that the initial effect of the agonist is to pull the bottom part of VFD3/TAS1R3 toward the bottom part of VFD2/TAS1R2 by ∼6 Å and that these changes get transmitted from VFD2 of TAS1R2 (where agonists bind) through the VFD3 and the CRD3 to the TMD3 of TAS1R3 (which couples to the G protein). These structural transformations provide a detailed atomistic mechanism for the activation process in GPCR, providing insights and structural details that can now be validated through mutation experiments.},

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8164-8169). A large variety of amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments of SecA were prepared in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. SecA analogues were then reconstituted from them and examined for their ability to cross-link with [35S]proOmpF-Lpp, a presecretory protein, in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. The reconstituted SecA analogues were active in the cross-linking with proOmpF-Lpp when the SecA fragments used were large enough to structurally complement each other. The cross-linking was signal peptide-dependent and suppressed in the presence of other presecretory proteins. The cross-linking was enhanced in the presence of ATP. The SecA fragments that cross-linked with proOmpF-Lpp were then analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The cross-linking preferentially took place on fragments possessing the amino terminus of SecA. Weak cross-linking was also observed with carboxyl-terminal fragments when they were large enough. The smallest amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments with which the cross-linking was observed were 39 and 72 kDa, respectively. From these results, the region responsible for the cross-linking with presecretory proteins was deduced to be located between amino acid residues 267 and 340 from the amino terminus of SecA. These results are discussed in relation to the structure and function of SecA.},

  abstract = {Taste bud type II cells fire action potentials in response to tastants, triggering nonvesicular ATP release to gustatory neurons via voltage-gated CALHM1-associated ion channels. Whereas CALHM1 regulates mouse cortical neuron excitability, its roles in regulating type II cell excitability are unknown. In this study, we compared membrane conductances and action potentials in single identified TRPM5-GFP-expressing circumvallate papillae type II cells acutely isolated from wild-type (WT) and Calhm1 knockout (KO) mice. The activation kinetics of large voltage-gated outward currents were accelerated in cells from Calhm1 KO mice, and their associated nonselective tail currents, previously shown to be highly correlated with ATP release, were completely absent in Calhm1 KO cells, suggesting that CALHM1 contributes to all of these currents. Calhm1 deletion did not significantly alter resting membrane potential or input resistance, the amplitudes and kinetics of Na               +               currents either estimated from action potentials or recorded from steady-state voltage pulses, or action potential threshold, overshoot peak, afterhyperpolarization, and firing frequency. However, Calhm1 deletion reduced the half-widths of action potentials and accelerated the deactivation kinetics of transient outward currents, suggesting that the CALHM1-associated conductance becomes activated during the repolarization phase of action potentials.                                         NEW \& NOTEWORTHY CALHM1 is an essential ion channel component of the ATP neurotransmitter release mechanism in type II taste bud cells. Its contribution to type II cell resting membrane properties and excitability is unknown. Nonselective voltage-gated currents, previously associated with ATP release, were absent in cells lacking CALHM1. Calhm1 deletion was without effects on resting membrane properties or voltage-gated Na               +               and K               +               channels but contributed modestly to the kinetics of action potentials.},

Protonation states are modeled with different charge sets, and titrating residues sample a Boltzmann distribution of protonation states as the simulation progresses, using Monte Carlo sampling based on GB-derived energies. The method is applied to four different crystal structures of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL). pKa predictions derived from the simulations have root-mean-square (RMS) error of 0.82 relative to experimental values. Similarity of results between the four crystal structures shows the method to be independent of starting crystal structure; this is in contrast to most electrostatics-only models. A strong correlation between conformation and protonation state is noted and quantitatively analyzed, emphasizing the importance of sampling protonation states in conjunction with dynamics. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Efficient sampling of equilibrium states                            Molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods can be used to sample equilibrium states, but these methods become computationally expensive for complex systems, where the transition from one equilibrium state to another may only occur through rare events. Noé               et al.               used neural networks and deep learning to generate distributions of independent soft condensed-matter samples at equilibrium (see the Perspective by Tuckerman). Supervised training is used to construct invertible transformations between the coordinates of the complex system of interest and simple Gaussian coordinates of the same dimensionality. Thus, configurations can be sampled in this simpler coordinate system and then transformed back into the complex one using the correct statistical weighting.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaaw1147               ; see also p.               982                        ,              By combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, neural networks sample the equilibrium distribution of many-body systems.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Statistical mechanics aims to compute the average behavior of physical systems on the basis of their microscopic constituents. For example, what is the probability that a protein will be folded at a given temperature? If we could answer such questions efficiently, then we could not only comprehend the workings of molecules and materials, but we could also design drug molecules and materials with new properties in a principled way.               To this end, we need to compute statistics of the equilibrium states of many-body systems. In the protein-folding example, this means to consider each of the astronomically many ways to place all protein atoms in space, to compute the probability of each such “configuration” in the equilibrium ensemble, and then to compare the total probability of unfolded and folded configurations.               As enumeration of all configurations is infeasible, one instead must attempt to sample them from their equilibrium distribution. However, we currently have no way to generate equilibrium samples of many-body systems in “one shot.” The main approach is thus to start with one configuration, e.g., the folded protein state, and make tiny changes to it over time, e.g., by using Markov-chain Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics (MD). However, these simulations get trapped in metastable (long-lived) states: For example, sampling a single folding or unfolding event with atomistic MD may take a year on a supercomputer.                                         RATIONALE               Here, we combine deep machine learning and statistical mechanics to develop Boltzmann generators. Boltzmann generators are trained on the energy function of a many-body system and learn to provide unbiased, one-shot samples from its equilibrium state. This is achieved by training an invertible neural network to learn a coordinate transformation from a system’s configurations to a so-called latent space representation, in which the low-energy configurations of different states are close to each other and can be easily sampled. Because of the invertibility, every latent space sample can be back-transformed to a system configuration with high Boltzmann probability (Fig. 1). We then employ statistical mechanics, which offers a rich set of tools for reweighting the distribution generated by the neural network to the Boltzmann distribution.                                         RESULTS               Boltzmann generators can be trained to directly generate independent samples of low-energy structures of condensed-matter systems and protein molecules. When initialized with a few structures from different metastable states, Boltzmann generators can generate statistically independent samples from these states and efficiently compute the free-energy differences between them. This capability could be used to compute relative stabilities between different experimental structures of protein or other organic molecules, which is currently a very challenging problem. Boltzmann generators can also learn a notion of “reaction coordinates”: Simple linear interpolations between points in latent space have a high probability of corresponding to physically realistic, low-energy transition pathways. Finally, by using established sampling methods such as Metropolis Monte Carlo in the latent space variables, Boltzmann generators can discover new states and gradually explore state space.                                         CONCLUSION               Boltzmann generators can overcome rare event–sampling problems in many-body systems by learning to generate unbiased equilibrium samples from different metastable states in one shot. They differ conceptually from established enhanced sampling methods, as no reaction coordinates are needed to drive them between metastable states. However, by applying existing sampling methods in the latent spaces learned by Boltzmann generators, a plethora of new opportunities opens up to design efficient sampling methods for many-body systems.                                                   Boltzmann generators overcome sampling problems between long-lived states.                                        The Boltzmann generator works as follows: 1. We sample from a simple (e.g., Gaussian) distribution. 2. An invertible deep neural network is trained to transform this simple distribution to a distribution                                                                                                                             p                             X                                                                                   (                             x                             )                                                                                                                     that is similar to the desired Boltzmann distribution of the system of interest. 3. To compute thermodynamics quantities, the samples are reweighted to the Boltzmann distribution using statistical mechanics methods.                                                                                            ,              Computing equilibrium states in condensed-matter many-body systems, such as solvated proteins, is a long-standing challenge. Lacking methods for generating statistically independent equilibrium samples in “one shot,” vast computational effort is invested for simulating these systems in small steps, e.g., using molecular dynamics. Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we developed Boltzmann generators, which are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed-matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The molecular mechanism of the anthracycline-dependent development of cardiotoxicity is still far from being clear. However, it is generally accepted, that mitochondria play a significant role in triggering this organ specific injury. The results presented in this study demonstrate that, in contrast to liver mitochondria, isolated heart mitochondria shuttle single electrons to adriamycin, giving rise to oxygen radical formation via autoxidation of adria­mycin semiquinones. This one electron reduction of anthracyclines is catalyzed by the exoge­nous NADH dehydrogenase associated with complex I of heart mitochondria, an enzyme which is lacking in liver mitochondria. Upon addition of NADH heart mitochondria generate significant amounts of adriamycin sem iquinones while liver mitochondria were ineffective. Adriamycin semiquinones undergo both autoxidation leading to superoxide radical release and complex reactions under formation of adriamycin aglycone. Due to the high lipophilicity adriamycin aglycones accumulate in the inner mitochondrial membrane where they interfere with electron carriers of the respiratory chain. Adriamycin aglycone sem iquinones emerging from an interaction with complex I were found to trigger homolytic cleavage of H               2               O               2               which results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals. As demonstrated in this study the activation of adriamycin by the exogenous NADH dehydrogenase of cardiac mitochondria initiates a cas­cade of reaction steps leading to the establishment of oxidative stress.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            BMS-232632 is an azapeptide human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (Prt) inhibitor that exhibits potent anti-HIV activity with a 50\% effective concentration (EC               50               ) of 2.6 to 5.3 nM and an EC               90               of 9 to 15 nM in cell culture. Proof-of-principle studies indicate that BMS-232632 blocks the cleavage of viral precursor proteins in HIV-infected cells, proving that it functions as an HIV Prt inhibitor. Comparative studies showed that BMS-232632 is generally more potent than the five currently approved HIV-1 Prt inhibitors. Furthermore, BMS-232632 is highly selective for HIV-1 Prt and exhibits cytotoxicity only at concentrations 6,500- to 23,000-fold higher than that required for anti-HIV activity. To assess the potential of this inhibitor when used in combination with other antiretrovirals, BMS-232632 was evaluated for anti-HIV activity in two-drug combination studies. Combinations of BMS-232632 with either stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, zidovudine, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or amprenavir in HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells yielded additive to moderately synergistic antiviral effects. Importantly, combinations of drug pairs did not result in antagonistic anti-HIV activity or enhanced cytotoxic effects at the highest concentrations used for antiviral evaluation. Our results suggest that BMS-232632 may be an effective HIV-1 inhibitor that may be utilized in a variety of different drug combinations.},

In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generative models have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials.},

However, the widespread use of GQDs is hindered by the poor understanding of their photoluminescence (PL) mechanisms. Using density-functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations, we reveal that the PL of a GQD can be sensitively tuned by its size, edge configuration, shape, attached chemical functionalities, heteroatom doping and defects. In addition, it is discovered that the PL of a large GQD consisting of heterogeneously hybridized carbon network is essentially determined by the embedded small sp               2               clusters isolated by sp               3               carbons. This study not only provides an explanation to the previous experimental observations but also provides insightful guidance to develop methods for the controllable synthesis and engineering of GQDs.},

This iodine-catalyzed approach enables β C–H amination of alcohols by an imidate-mediated radical relay. In contrast to our first-generation, (super)stoichiometric protocol, this catalytic method enables faster and more efficient reactivity. Furthermore, lower oxidant concentration affords broader functional group tolerance, including alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, carbonyls, and heteroarenes. Mechanistic experiments interrogating the electronic nature of the key 1,5 H-atom transfer event are included, as well as probes for chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selectivity.},

  abstract = {By utilizing Graphics Processing Units, we show that constant pH molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD) run in Generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent for long time scales can yield poor pKa predictions as a result of sampling unrealistic conformations. To address this shortcoming, we present a method for performing constant pH molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD) in explicit solvent using a discrete protonation state model. The method involves standard molecular dynamics (MD) being propagated in explicit solvent followed by protonation state changes being attempted in GB implicit solvent at fixed intervals. Replica exchange along the pH-dimension (pH-REMD) helps to obtain acceptable titration behavior with the proposed method. We analyzed the effects of various parameters and settings on the titration behavior of CpHMD and pH-REMD in explicit solvent, including the size of the simulation unit cell and the length of the relaxation dynamics following protonation state changes. We tested the method with the amino acid model compounds, a small pentapeptide with two titratable sites, and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). The proposed method yields superior predicted pKa values for HEWL over hundreds of nanoseconds of simulation relative to corresponding predicted values from simulations run in implicit solvent.},

To investigate the genetic basis for this taste dysfunction, we screened 610 BTBR × NZW/LacJ F               2               hybrids, identified a potent QTL on chromosome 17, and isolated this in a congenic strain. Mice carrying the BTBR/BTBR haplotype in the 0.8-Mb (21-gene) congenic region were indifferent to sweet, Polycose, umami, bitter, and calcium tastes. To assess the contribution of a likely causative culprit, Itpr3, the inositol triphosphate receptor 3 gene, we produced and tested Itpr3 knockout mice. These were also indifferent to GPCR-mediated taste compounds. Sequencing the BTBR form of Itpr3 revealed a unique 12 bp deletion in Exon 23 (Chr 17: 27238069; Build 37). We conclude that a spontaneous mutation of Itpr3 in a progenitor of the BTBR strain produced a heretofore unrecognized dysfunction of GPCR-mediated taste transduction.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Results suggested that the center N-GQD had a better performance than the pristine and edge N-GQDs.           ,                             The amount and type of nitrogen (N) functionalities in graphene quantum dots can be controlled by tuning the synthesis conditions, which gives rise to their diverse applications. Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) are highly biocompatible and their properties can be easily tuned. In this work, the role of different N-functionalities in the drug delivery performance of N-GQDs was investigated               via               molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicated that the magnitude of binding energy between the gemcitabine (GC) drug and the central N-GQDs,               i.e.               , graphitic, pyridinic and amido, was greater than that of pristine GQDs and edge N-GQDs. The quantum molecular descriptors revealed that adsorption of GC drug on the nanocarriers enhanced the chemical reactivity. The adsorption of the GC drug on the nanocarriers was spontaneously proceeded. However, the Gibbs free energy values for adsorption of the GC drug on the center N-GQDs were greater than those of pristine GQDs and edge N-GQDs. Also, the nature of the intermolecular interactions between the GC drug and nanocarriers was further investigated through quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and noncovalent interaction index (NCI). The simulation results demonstrated that the GC drug was loaded on the surface of all nanocarriers, while favorable drug release could occur only from the center N-GQDs in acidic environments of cancer tissues. Finally, the mechanism for the penetration of the drug-loaded nanocarriers across the cell membrane was studied and discussed               via               steered molecular dynamics (SMD). The results indicated that the force required to pull the drug-loaded nanocarriers was the smallest when the nanocarriers were penetrated perpendicularly rather than parallelly or obliquely into the membrane plane. Overall, the results suggested that the center N-GQDs had better performance in drug delivery than pristine GQDs and edge N-GQDs. Our findings offer insightful information on efficient utilization of N-GQDs as drug delivery systems.},

The hybrid NPs can enter the intracellular region and illuminate mouse melanoma B16F10 cells under different excitation wavelengths.

  abstract = {A radical-mediated strategy for β C−H amination of alcohols has been developed. This approach employs a radical relay chaperone, which serves as a traceless director that facilitates selective C−H functionalization via 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and enables net incorporation of ammonia at the β carbon of alcohols. The chaperones presented herein enable direct access to imidate radicals, allowing their first use for H atom abstraction. A streamlined protocol enables rapid conversion of alcohols to their β-amino analogs (via in situ conversion of alcohols to imidates, directed C−H amination, and hydrolysis to NH2). Mechanistic experiments indicate HAT is rate-limiting, whereas intramolecular amination is product- and stereo-determining.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Molecular recognition plays a central role in biochemical processes. Although well studied, understanding the mechanisms of recognition is inherently difficult due to the range of potential interactions, the molecular rearrangement associated with binding, and the time and length scales involved. Computational methods have the potential for not only complementing experiments that have been performed, but also in guiding future ones through their predictive abilities. In this review, we discuss how molecular dynamics (MD) simulations may be used in advancing our understanding of the thermodynamics that drive biomolecular recognition. We begin with a brief review of the statistical mechanics that form a basis for these methods. This is followed by a description of some of the most commonly used methods: thermodynamic pathways employing alchemical transformations and potential of mean force calculations, along with end-point calculations for free energy differences, and harmonic and quasi-harmonic analysis for entropic calculations. Finally, a few of the fundamental findings that have resulted from these methods are discussed, such as the role of configurational entropy and solvent in intermolecular interactions, along with selected results of the model system T4 lysozyme to illustrate potential and current limitations of these methods.},
