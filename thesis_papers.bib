  abstract = {Recent calorimetric studies of interactions between small molecules and biomolecular targets have generated renewed interest in the phenomenon of entropy-enthalpy compensation. In these studies, entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding are observed to vary substantially and in an opposing manner as the ligand or protein is modified, whereas the binding free energy varies little. In severe examples, engineered enthalpic gains can lead to completely compensating entropic penalties, frustrating ligand design. Here, we examine the evidence for compensation, as well as its potential origins, prevalence, severity, and ramifications for ligand engineering. We find the evidence for severe compensation to be weak in light of the large magnitude of and correlation between errors in experimental measurements of entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding, though a limited form of compensation may be common. Given the difficulty of predicting or measuring entropic and enthalpic changes to useful precision, or using this information in design, we recommend ligand engineering efforts instead focus on computational and experimental methodologies to directly assess changes in binding free energy.},

  abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein\textendash ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

To do this, we conducted baseline docking calculations of structurally diverse compounds in the DUD-E database for three targets, BACE1, CDK2 and thrombin, followed by ABFE calculations for compounds with high docking scores. The docking calculations alone achieved solid enrichment of active compounds over decoys. Encouragingly, the ABFE calculations then improved on this baseline. Analysis of the results emphasizes the importance of establishing high quality ligand poses as starting points for ABFE calculations, a nontrivial goal when processing a library of diverse compounds without informative co-crystal structures. Overall, our results suggest that ABFE calculations can play a valuable role in the drug discovery process.},

However, these calculations can be complex to implement and perform. Here, we introduce the software BAT.py, a Python tool that invokes the AMBER simulation package to fully automate the calculation of binding free energies for a protein with a series of ligands. We report encouraging initial test applications of this software both to re-rank docked poses and to estimate overall binding free energies. We also show that it is practical to carry out these calculations cheaply by using graphical processing units in common machines that can be built for this purpose. The combination of automation and low cost allows this procedure to be applied in a relatively high-throughput mode, and thus enables new applications in early-stage drug discovery.},

ABT-538 exhibited potent in vitro activity against laboratory and clinical strains of HIV-1 [50\% effective concentration (EC50) = 0.022-0.13 microM] and HIV-2 (EC50 = 0.16 microM). Following a single 10-mg/kg oral dose, plasma concentrations in rat, dog, and monkey exceeded the in vitro antiviral EC50 for {$>$} 12 h. In human trials, a single 400-mg dose of ABT-538 displayed a prolonged absorption profile and achieved a peak plasma concentration in excess of 5 micrograms/ml. These findings demonstrate that high oral bioavailability can be achieved in humans with peptidomimetic inhibitors of HIV protease.},

A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            BMS-232632 is an azapeptide human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (Prt) inhibitor that exhibits potent anti-HIV activity with a 50\% effective concentration (EC               50               ) of 2.6 to 5.3 nM and an EC               90               of 9 to 15 nM in cell culture. Proof-of-principle studies indicate that BMS-232632 blocks the cleavage of viral precursor proteins in HIV-infected cells, proving that it functions as an HIV Prt inhibitor. Comparative studies showed that BMS-232632 is generally more potent than the five currently approved HIV-1 Prt inhibitors. Furthermore, BMS-232632 is highly selective for HIV-1 Prt and exhibits cytotoxicity only at concentrations 6,500- to 23,000-fold higher than that required for anti-HIV activity. To assess the potential of this inhibitor when used in combination with other antiretrovirals, BMS-232632 was evaluated for anti-HIV activity in two-drug combination studies. Combinations of BMS-232632 with either stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, zidovudine, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or amprenavir in HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells yielded additive to moderately synergistic antiviral effects. Importantly, combinations of drug pairs did not result in antagonistic anti-HIV activity or enhanced cytotoxic effects at the highest concentrations used for antiviral evaluation. Our results suggest that BMS-232632 may be an effective HIV-1 inhibitor that may be utilized in a variety of different drug combinations.},

The force field is the cornerstone of computer simulations, and many force fields have been developed and successfully applied in these simulations. Two interesting areas are (a) studying enzyme catalytic mechanisms using a combination of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics, and (b) studying macromolecular dynamics and interactions using molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy (FE) calculation methods. Enzyme catalysis involves forming and breaking of covalent bonds and requires the use of quantum mechanics. Noncovalent interactions appear ubiquitously in biology, but here we confine ourselves to review only noncovalent interactions between protein and protein, protein and ligand, and protein and nucleic acids.},
