\title{Automated, efficient and rigorous absolute binding free energy calculations}
\author{Steven Ayoub Jr}
\committee{Tyler Luchko}{Ravi Abrol}{Miao}

\abstract{
	Identifying small drug-like molecules for therapeutic targets of interest is an ongoing effort in drug discovery. Accurate absolute binding free energy calculations (ABFEs) in silico, can reduce the time and cost of exploring a diverse set of potential drug candidates that may have been overlooked experimentally. However, these calculations usually employ explicit solvent models that can be computationally demanding and difficult to implement and perform. To circumvent these drawbacks, we introduced the software ISDDM.py, a Python automated workflow that implements an approach that uses faster implicit solvents, such as generalized Born (GB), which greatly reduces computational costs. We adapted the double decoupling method (DDM), which uses conformational restraints, and paired it with GB solvent to enhance convergence. The software is tested on 83 unique host-guest complex systems and reports encouraging results in estimating binding free energies. Our work here attempts to reduce the computational expense of absolute binding free energies by using implicit solvent models and the ISDDM.py package to handle all the input files, monitor the simulations and perform post-analysis.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the plagues of history, to influenza epidemics , cancer and the most
 recent COVID-19 virus outbreak, the world population is constantly facing
 life-threatening events and diseases.
 Drug discovery, production, and implementation have been a huge part of
 preventing or improving outcomes from these events and diseases.
 Modern drug development requires the screening of a vast and diverse chemical
 space, with the aim to simultaneously optimize properties such as protein-ligan
d affinity.
 However, this process is often risky, costly, and very time-consuming.
 Currently, the conventional process of a potential drug candidate to reach
 the market has been estimated to take an average of 14 years, reaching
 up to 1.8 billion USD and an attrition rate as high as 96% 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Therefore, the ability to efficiently and quickly scan a large chemical
 for potential drug candidates is a major focus in drug discovery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attempts to exploring chemical space date back to the early drug discovery
 period (before the 19th century), during which chemists expanded their
 knowledge of chemical space at an exponential rate, from a handful of new
 substances in 1800 up to 11,000 in 1868

 to the drug discovery and drug development period (20th century and beyond).
 It was not until the “post-genome era,” during the late 20th century that
 a huge surge of protein crystal structures were made publicly available
 and became targets of therapeutic interest for small-molecule drug discovery
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "reymondChemicalSpaceProject2015"

\end_inset

.
 This resulted in a shift of drug discovery strategies that focused largely
 on high-throughput screening (HTS), leading to the identification of multiple
 therapeutic drug targets and the creation of very large compound libraries
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jhotiHighthroughputScreeningStructurebased2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Despite this, HTS operates on the fundamental basis that assumes no prior
 knowledge of the drug binding site on the target protein.
 This led to an “irrational” drug design approach in which many pharmaceutical
 companies saw a decrease in launched drug candidates that were successful
 in the market.

As an alternative approach, computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) provides
 a rational structure-based approach that can yield valuable information
 about intermolecular interactions between protein and ligand systems, as
 well as the binding affinity.
 CADD has already been successfully applied in all areas of drug discovery
 and has brought new drug compounds to the market for diverse diseases,
 including HIV-1-inhibiting drugs (amprenavir

.The use of molecular simulations in drug discovery has had a major impact
 in the past decade, as the rapid development of computer hardware and new
 algorithms has allowed computations to becomes time-affordable.
 The computational microscope provided by CADD shows how ligands bind to
 a targeted receptor, proteins interact with each other, and proteins aggregate
 in the cell membrane.
 It is not only important for rational drug design but also for the field
 of biophysics and biochemistry.
 An example is molecular docking programs which provides a fast and efficient
 way to screen a large number of potential drug candidates

, which are widely used to target the binding site and compute the ligand
 binding affinity.
 Although molecular docking provides a fast and efficient way to screen
 a large number of potential drug candidates, the accuracy of docking is
 limited by approximations used to achieve high computational speed.
 Docking programs usually treat the receptor as a rigid molecule, employ
 simple models of the receptor, ligand and water, and handle conformational
 fluctuations with a gross approximation.

 Today, classical MD simulations of protein and ligand binding events can
 last up to a few microseconds and have a sufficient degree of accuracy
 for drug design.
 Despite this success, classical MD suffers from insufficient sampling of
 conformational states due to the high computational demands of simulations
 greater than a microsecond in length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter of these problems, insufficient sampling is due to the size of
 the integration time-step of MD, usually limited to femtoseconds or shorter
 (dictated by bond vibrations), whereas binding process are in the micro/millise
cond time scale.
 This leads to large computational costs to sample important configurations
 that have a major contribution towards binding affinity.
 Beyond the computational cost, insufficient sampling is a well-recognized
 problem in molecular simulations due to the fact there are high energy
 barriers separating structures/conformations, resulting in biological systems
 to become trapped in deep energy wells of their potential energy surfaces

 Enhanced sampling techniques can accelerate thermodynamics calculations
 by making rare transition conformations more likely.

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than following a physical pathway between two states, one can construct
 a non-physical pathway that involves transforming one molecule to another,
 avoiding the need of exhaustive sampling.
 This type of unphysical pathway is referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

alchemical transformation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and has emerged as a useful tool for predicting free energy differences,
 such as the binding of a small molecule to a receptor.
 The term “alchemical” was coined by the fact that, in silico, a molecule
 can be transformed into a different, even non-interacting, molecule, where
 its respective potentials are switched off through a series of intermediate
 steps.
 Most alchemical methods utilize free energy perturbation (FEP) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 or thermodynamic integration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to mathematically calculate the change in free energy.
 Early efforts demonstrated that MD and Monte Carlo simulations could carry
 out these calculations for biomolecular systems [

].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most popular alchemical methods are relative binding free energy (RBFE)
 calculations.
 RBFE calculations yield the change in binding free energy between two compounds
 by computing by artificially transforming one compound to the other in
 the binding site.
 RBFE requires prior knowledge of the reference compound’s binding affinity
 and requires that the two compounds being prepared are structurally and
 chemically similar.
 RBFE play a significant role in the lead optimization occurring in the
 later states in drug discovery, such as making small structural changes
 to a lead candidate compound to create a molecula with higher affinity
 towards targeted host system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schindlerLargeScaleAssessmentBinding2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.However, RBFE requires structural similarity between molecules which in
 turn limits its capability of exploring chemical space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations are capable
 of computing the standard free energy difference between a given compound
 and the receptor of interest.
 The standard free energy difference is computed from the reversible work
 of decoupling the ligand from the binding site and recouping it with the
 bulk solvent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fengAbsoluteBindingFree2022"

.
 Importantly, ABFE can be applied to a diverse chemical space without requiring
 prior knowledge of any binding affinities or structural similarities between
 compounds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "courniaRigorousFreeEnergy2020,gilsonStatisticalthermodynamicBasisComputation1997a"

 Therefore, ABFE is more suitable for the virtual screening of diverse ligands
 but suffers from computational expense and the design (setup/running calculatio
ns) can be complicated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigorous ABFE calculations require a thermodynamic pathway of overlapping
 intermediate states to connect the bound and unbound end-states to produce
 reliable binding affinity calculations.
 A widely used approach, the double decoupling method (DDM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gilsonStatisticalthermodynamicBasisComputation1997a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses a series of alchemical steps to estimate the absolute binding free
 energy.
 The DDM cycle consists of two physically meaningful end states (i.e bound
 and unbound states) and a series of intermediate states where the ligand
 is decoupled from the environment.
 The ligand intermolecular and intramolecular interactions are removed through
 a series of intermediate windows by scaling its electrostatics and van
 der Waals (VDW) interactions to zero.
 In this way, the two molecules (receptor and ligand) are brought together
 without having to account for complicated interactions during the binding
 process and then gradually turning back on the interactions of the ligand
 allowing it to go through the physical binding process.
 Nevertheless, the DDM method is known to suffer from poor convergence without
 intramolecular interactions of the ligand.
 The ligands may collide or overlap in physical space, creating enormous
 potential energies and numerical instabilities.
 To prevent this from occurring, artificial restraints are used to keep
 the ligand from leaving the binding pocket and stop it from interacting
 with the environment.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "boreschAbsoluteBindingFree2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The use of these restraints is necessary to ensure conformations are sampled
 during the simulations and aids in good phase space overlap and faster
 convergence.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, accurate sampling only helps if the molecular model, including
 the solvent environment, is accurate.
 Explicit solvents are full atomic representations of water molecules that
 surround the solute, providing a physically detailed and generally accurate
 model; DDM was conceived with explicit solvents in mind.
 However, the inclusion of these explicit water molecules causes the simulations
 to be computationally expensive because the degrees of freedom of each
 water molecule must be calculated for every time-step 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "durrantMolecularDynamicsSimulations2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, explicit solvent can cause “singularity events” when solute-solve
nt steric overlap occurs.
 The use of soft-core potentials 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "leeAlchemicalBindingFree2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is used in order to minimize or resolve the instabilities observed during
 the decoupling of the VDW parameters by shifting the inter-particle distance
 between the solute and solvent atoms.
 To avoid the extra complexity and computational costs of using explicit
 solvents, implicit solvents may be used.
 Implicit solvents are well suited for the DDM approach as the solvent degrees
 of freedom (DOF) are integrated out and solute-solvent steric overlap does
 not occur.
 Rather than physically representing water molecules, implicit solvent models
 provide a mean-field dielectric representation.
 Two popular pathway techniques that utilized implicit solvent models that
 have been widely exploited in free energy calculations are molecular mechanics/
Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics/generalized
 Born surface area (MM/GBSA)

Our work attempts to reduce the complexity and computational cost of ABFE
 calculations by using implicit solvent models while achieving reliability
 and accuracy.
 To do this, we use a modified DDM cycle that uses conformational restraints
 and the generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent model to enhance convergence.
 Our DDM cycle provides improved sampling at the end states while reducing
 the need for sampling in intermediate states.
 We aim to prove that ABFE calculations can be performed for diverse ligands
 and can be done in a fast, efficient, and effective manner.
 To this end, we created the Implicit Solvent DDM tool (
\begin_inset Flex Code

), a command line Python interface, to facilitate and automate the use of
 ABFE calculations for virtual compound screening.
 The ISDDM package begins with a parametrized model of the complex and performs
 all calculations of the alchemical cycle, post-processing, and data analysis.
 Our implementation utilizes the open-source AmberTools molecular modeling
 suite to maximize computational throughput.

Intermediate states-provide better phase space overlap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intermediate states are needed to obtain a reliable estimate of binding
 free energy difference.
 In order to compute accurate free energy differences between two states
 their phase space integrals must have sufficient overlap meaning the two
 states are similar.
 Typically, this is almost never the case for bound and unbound states as
 the end-states have poor space phase overlap, leading to large uncertainties
 in computing the free energy difference.
 Therefore, appropriately selected intermediate states can make free energy
 calculations more efficient by bridging the gap between the target end-states

 Each state is defined by a different Hamiltonian.
 Since free energy is a state function, the path that connects the states
 is unimportant and we can select a cycle that connects any two states through
 several nonphysical intermediate ones, such as those shown in

 Though other paths may be used, the simplest path to construct between
 two Hamiltonians is linear:

Molecular Modeling of physical chemistry of binding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the free energy differences accurately, a molecular model is
 required that describes the relevant physical properties of a system correctly.
 Specifically, the Hamiltonian used to calculate the energy and forces should
 ensure that all configurations will be sampled with the correct probability.
 In practice, the choice of the Hamiltonian is often a compromise between
 accuracy and efficiency.
 Two major factors that dictate the cost of the energy and force evaluation
 are the degrees of freedom and the functional form of the Hamiltonian.
 A quantum-mechanical description of the system provides the most detailed
 description, as the electrons' degrees of freedom are modeled explicitly
 and the interaction energy is calculated by solving electronic structure
 of the system.
 In the molecular mechanics (MM) description, molecules are represented
 by particles, which represent atoms or groups of atoms.
 The quantum-mechanical description of the system will generally be more
 computationally demanding than classical molecular models.
 Here we focus on classical Hamiltonians that incorporate fixed point charges.
 These type of Hamiltonians are referred as to

Water plays a fundamental role in molecular association and mediates protein-lig
and interactions.
 Commonly, explicit water models are used, in which a large number of individual
 water molecules are placed around the solute and modeled with approximately
 the same theoretical level as the solute.
 While explicit models are generally a realistic representation of an water
 environment, they are computationally demanding.
 Moreover, water exchange between bulk and buried cavities can be slow and
 leads to inefficient sampling of water occupancy states

Host-guest (HG) systems have emerge an ideal benchmark for the quantitative
 assessment of modeling errors for the interactions of ligand-host binding.
 They tend to have low molecular weight and capture most of the interactions
 involved in protein-ligand binding, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals
 interactions and conformational changes upon binding.
 Due to there small molecular size sampling can be done more efficiently,
 and experimental data are available for wide variety of HG systems.
 Therefore, HG systems are good candidates to help focus on development
 computational modeling schemes to create an reliable and efficient method
 to estimate ligand-host binding affinity.
 To test thermodynamic cycle and our software implementation of it, we selected
 host-guest systems from the Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins

 MBAR requires the potential energies of each coordinate trajectory to be

 From the final frame of the complex in state 8, conformational and orientationa

 The same frame is used to generate the initial coordinates for states 2-7.
 For states 2-4, the receptor and ligand are spilt from the complex end-state
 structure.
 All the intermediate MD states are run simultaneously and executed in parallel
 using the maximum number of processors specified in the input file.
 As MD simulations complete, their trajectories are pushed into the post-analysi
s queue to gather all the necessary state comparison and energies.
 The post-processed data is then parsed into a Pandas DataFrame

 However, the binding free energy of G8 was overestimated in contrast to
 the rest of the ligands .Calculated statistics that computed free energies
 had a deviation (RMSE=6.64 kcal/mol) and a decent correlation (

 On average the predicated binding affinity was 6.1kcal/mol and a MSE of
 -6.0kcal/mol.
 The high MAE and MSE indicates poor accuracy of predicated binding free
 energy values.
 The large MAE and MSE is probably cause the generalize Born lack of charge
 hydration of the positively charge guest molecules which results in the
 overestimation of binding.

-cyclodextrin (ACD) had RMSE= 1.6 kcal/mol compared to experiment.
 ACD had slope of 0.8 with MAE and MSE of 1.4 and 0.07 kcal/mol, while BCD
 had a slope of 1.5 and an MAE and MSE of 1.4 and -0.7 kcal/mol.
 Interestingly, we observed a stronger correlation between calculated and
 experimental for BCD (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.65$
\end_inset

) compared to ACD (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.17$
\end_inset

).
 This likely be due to the fact BCD has a larger dynamic range of binding
 free energies than ACD.

e-f shows a clear bias in the error of the ABFE due to ligand charges, which
 have been similar trend in the other host guest systems.
 Here, we see the ABFEs for the negatively charged ligands are underestimating
 and positively charge ligands are overestimating the binding affinity.
 These results suggest significant bias due to ligand charge.

shows the computed statistics for the combine dataset have an RMSE of 4.1
 and correlation of 0.76.
 In all the test cases, we clearly see the ligand net charge strongly affects
 the calculated ABFEs.
 This may be due to the fact that GB does not naturally handle charge hydration
 asymmetry

.
 However, the host charge has little impact on the ABFE.
 WP6 and OAH have net charges of -6 and -8 respectively, but seem to follow
 the same trends as the other molecules.

 The correction depends only on ligand charge and is independent of host

 One reason why host charge appears irrelevant is that both WP6 and OAH
 charge carbonyl atoms were solvent exposed when the ligand was bound.

, which employed COSMO-RS(conductor-like screening model for real solvents)
 and OST (orthogonal space tempering) with TIP3P-MOD(transferable interaction
 potential three-point).
 It should be noted that both these methods are significantly more computational
 demanding where COSMO-RS starts with a quantum chemical continuum solvation
 calculations and OST method implements explicit solvation model.
 However all the other metrics of the uncorrected method yields better results
 by comparison ahead of these top performers.

There are two methods that use Bennet acceptance ratio (BAR) method which
 evaluates free energy differences between two states rather all states
 compared to MBAR.The two submission that used BAR both used atomic multipole
 optimized energetics for biomolecular simulation (AMOEBA) force field with
 explicit solvent.
 Both of there correlation and slope are identical with values of 1.3 and
 0.6 respectively.
 However when comparing our uncorrected method we see an overall better
 improvements.

A total of 5 entires use an implicit solvent model and among these methods
 we outperformed all 5 of them.
 The RRHO/COSMO and M2/PBSA are more detailed predecessor than GBSA solvent.
 Where our method seemed to outperform all the implicit applicants.
 Explicit solvent models which are considered a more detailed models seemed
 to varied with correlations(
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

) that range from 0 to 0.8.
 As stated before OST/TIP3P-MOD explicit solvent (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.8)$
\end_inset

which presented three approaches that utilizes quantum mechanics with implicit
 solvent.
 QM-VM2 restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF-D3) and QM-VM2(TPSS-D3) have an improved
 slope, but relatively the identical metrics compared to our uncorrected
 method.
 The quantum mechanical method should provide a more accurate model but
 is computationally en tensive.
 However we see our faster sampling uncorrected method is achieving same
 level of accuracy with quantum mechanical method and is promising in virtual
 screening campaigns.

with RMSE 6.6kcal/mol having the largest deviation from the rank submissions.The
 trained MM/PBSA ELIE method is very similar to end-point calculations using
 an implicit solvent model GBSA.However this method required some system-specific
 training step sharing some similarities with ML based method and it is
 not fully physics based and is not directly transferable to other systems,
 especially for targets without known binding affinities

 However our corrected results would have the lowest RMSE error of 1.39 kcal/mol

Using our uncorrected method on the 23 guests, results were good for OAH
 with an slope of 0.52 and RMSE of 2.9kcal/mol.
 A poor correlation of 0.07 was due to two positive charge guests (tzh,hxa)
 which if omitted does improve the Pearson correlation to 0.54.

uncorrected predictions for octa-acid were adversely affected primarily
 the much lower binding free energies predicted for the positively charge
 ligands (trz, hxa) , which remain outliers, even after correction.Beyond
 charge hydration asymmetry, this may be the result of the large negative
 charge (
\begin_inset Formula $-8e$
\end_inset

) on the host, coupled with a lack of charge screening from our GB model.This
 may have caused the conformational reorganization of a flipped of benzoate
 ring that occurs for positively charge guests.During our end-state simulations
 we also observed the alkylammonium head group of the ligand forming strong
 short range electrostatic interactions with the benzoate group (

Generalize Born Hydration Asymmetry Correction Considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplicity of implicit solvent models by treating water structureless
 continuum dielectric medium provides fast estimation of solvation effects
 making them very popular for virtual screening.Generalize Born is arguably
 one the faster implicit models, due to approximating the Poisson-Boltzmann
 equation with a simple analytical formula.However, it is unable to account
 for several solvation properties that are treated with the more accurate
 explicit solvent models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One major approximation is the neglect of charge hydration asymmetry (CHA)

, which contributed towards solvation free energy

 on the sign of the charges of the solute.When considering our entire host-guest

, we clearly see a bias for all charge guest ligands.The absolute binding
 free energy estimates for positively charge guests was underestimated and
 negatively charge guests were overestimated.We also observe that the guest
 molecules have the dominant source of CHA error, as the charge of the host
 system had little or no effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applying a charge hydration correction based on the guests net charge (

 that the lack of charge hydration asymmetry in GB is the issue.

 which describes the solvent as a classical density distribution of the
 solvent sites around the solute, yields a more detailed molecular structure
 than GB models and naturally accounts for properties such as CHA and hydrogen
 bonding.
 Unfortunately, 3D-RISM is computational demanding and not suitable for
 high throughput screening campaigns at this time.
 However, improved implementation of 3D-RISM may change this.

The goal of this research was to create a simpler user interface that can
 automate a rigorous, modified ABFE cycle, allowing it to be applied over
 a broad chemical space.
 Although other automated absolute binding free energies programs exist

 is unique in that it improves sampling by using a combination of implicit
 solvents and conformational restraints.
 To test the automation of

, we applied it to a series of host guest systems which were presented as
 community challenge by SAMPL group.
 We saw overall good correlation with experiment, with our method (DDM/GB)
 and outperforms most the SAMPL4 and SAMPL9 challenge submission's RBFE
 metrics, though large systematic errors were present in the raw results.

\begin_layout Standard
One major issue with using generalize Born solvation method is its inability
 to account charge hydration asymmetry, leading towards the strong electrostatic
s interactions from charge guest molecules and bias in the results.
 From all the host guest systems shown in

\end_inset

a, we saw that positively charged guest molecules had significantly underestimat
ed binding free energy predictions, and negatively charge guests were overestima
ted.
 By applying a simple linear correction based on guest net charge, we observed
 much better correlation with and deviation from experiment, with RMSE values
 less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[1.4]{kcal/mol}$
\end_inset

.
 This correction greatly improved our overall accuracy across the entire
 dataset; however, this correction is likely not transferable.
 That is, the correction is not a solution but provides support that charge
 hydration asymmetry is the dominant source of error.Rather, a more accurate
 solvation model that could account for CHA and other thermodynamic water
 properties GB lacks will need to be employed.

In future analysis we plan on focusing on retrospective prediction of protein-li
gand binding affinity using public available databases such as BindingDB

 which includes curated datasets from the Drug Design Data Resource (D3R)
 and Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR).Subsequently, participate
 in future blind challenges to test our method ability to make prospective
 predictions.
 In addition, attempt to improve the overall accuracy by bookending with
 more accurate solvation models such as 3D-RISM.
 3D-RISM is computational demanding but potential remedies for this could
 include implementing 3D-RISM on GPUs or using Monte Carlo sampling scheme
 rather molecular dynamics route.
 Overall,

 calculations that combines the sampling efficiency of GB in a rigorous
