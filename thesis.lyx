Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the plagues of history to the influenza epidemic (1889-1890) and the
 most recent COVID-19 virus outbreak, the world population is constantly
 facing life-threatening events and diseases, such as cancer.
 Drug discovery, production, and implementation have been a huge part of
 preventing or improving these events and diseases.Modern drug development
 requires the screening of a vast and diverse chemical space with the aim
 to simultaneously optimize properties such as protein-ligand affinity.
 However, this process is often risky, costly, and very time-consuming.
 Currently, the conventional process of a potential drug candidate to reach
 the market has been estimated to take an average of 14 years, reaching
 up to 1.8 billion USD and an attrition rate as high as 96%

 Therefore, the ability to efficiently and quickly scan a large chemical
 for potential drug candidates is a major focus in drug discovery.

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the ability to efficiently and quickly scan a large chemical
 for potential drug candidates is a major focus in drug discovery.Attempts
 to exploring chemical space date back to the early drug discovery period
 (before the 19th century) during which chemists expanded the chemical space
 at an exponential rate from a handful of new substances in 1800 up to 11,000
 of 1868

and the drug discovery and drug development period (20th century and beyond).
 It was not until the “post-genome era,” during the late 20th century, where
 there was a huge surge of protein crystal structures that were made publicly
 available and become targets of therapeutic interest for small-molecule
 drug discovery

 on high-throughput screening (HTS), leading to the identification of multiple

 Despite this, HTS operates on the fundamental basis that assumes no prior
 knowledge of the drug binding site on the target protein.
 This led to an “irrational” drug design approach in which many pharmaceutical
 companies saw a decrease in launched drug candidates that were successful
 in the market.

As an alternative, computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) provides a rational
 structure-based approach that can yield valuable information about intermolecul
ar interactions between protein and ligand systems as well as the binding
 affinity.
 CADD has already been successfully applied in all areas of drug discovery
 and has brought new drug compounds to the market for diverse diseases,

The use of molecular simulations on drug discovery has shown major impact
 in the past decade in response to the rapid development of computer hardware
 and performing computations in a time affordable manner.
 Implementation of CADD provides an computational microscope how ligands
 bind to a targeted receptor, how proteins interact with each other, and
 how proteins aggregate in the cell membrane and is not only important for
 rational drug design but also for rational drug design the field of biophysics
 and biochemistry.
 An example is molecular docking programs

, which are widely used to target the binding site and compute the ligand
 binding affinity.
 Although molecular docking provides a fast and efficient way to screen
 a large number of potential drug candidates, the accuracy of docking is
 limited by approximations used to achieve high computational speed.
 Docking programs usually treat the receptor as a rigid molecule, employ
 simple models of the receptor, ligand and water, and handle conformational
 fluctuations with a gross approximation.

.Today, classical MD simulations of protein and ligand binding events can
 last up to a few microseconds and have a sufficient degree of accuracy.
 Despite this success, classical MD suffers from two major challenges: molecular
 modeling accuracy and insufficient sampling of conformational states due
 to the high computational demands of simulations greater than a microsecond
 in length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter of these problems, insufficient sampling is due to the size of
 the integration time-step of MD, usually limited to femtoseconds or shorter
 (dictated by bond vibrations), whereas binding process are in the micro/millise
cond time scale.
 This leads to large computational costs to sample important configurations
 that have a major contribution towards binding affinity.
 Beyond the computational cost, insufficient sampling is a well-recognized
 problem in molecular simulation due to the fact there are high energy barriers
 separating structures/conformations, resulting in biological systems to
 become trapped in deep energy wells of their potential energy surfaces

TL alchemical pathways to avoid exhaustive sampling
\end_layout

\end_inset

Rather than following a physical pathway between two states, one can construct
 a non-physical pathway that involves the transformation of one system to
 another avoiding the need of exhaustive sampling.
 These classes of unphysical pathways are referred to as alchemical transformati
on and have emerged as a useful tool for predicting free energy differences
 such as the binding of a small molecule to a receptor.
 The term “alchemical” was coined by the fact that, in silico, a molecule
 can be transformed into a non-interaction molecule, where its respective
 potentials are switched off through a series of intermediate steps.
 Most alchemical methods include free energy perturbation (FEP) [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alchemical methods can be classified as relative (RBFE) or absolute (ABFE)
 binding free energy calculations.
 RBFE calculations yield the binding free energy of two compounds by computing
 free energy change by artificially transforming one compound to the other
 in the binding site.
 RBFE requires prior knowledge of the reference compound’s binding affinity
 and requires that the two compounds being prepared are structurally and
 chemically similar.
 RBFE play a significant role in the lead optimization occurring in the
 later states in drug discovery, such as making small structural changes
 to a lead candidate compound to create a molecular with higher affinity
 towards targeted host system [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schindlerLargeScaleAssessmentBinding2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, RBFE requires structural similarity between molecules which in
 turn limits its capability of exploring chemical space.
 Conversely, ABFE calculations are capable of computing the standard free
 energy difference between a given compound and the receptor of interest.
 The standard free energy difference is computed from the reversible work
 of decoupling the ligand from the binding site and recouping it with the
 bulk solvent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fengAbsoluteBindingFree2022"

 Importantly, ABFE can be applied to diverse chemical space without requiring
 prior knowledge of any binding affinities or structural similarities between
 compounds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Therefore, ABFE is more suitable for the virtual screening of diverse ligands
 but suffers from computational expense and the design (setup/running calculatio
ns) can be complicated to perform

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigorous ABFE calculations require a thermodynamic pathway of overlapping
 intermediate states to connect the bound and unbound end-states to produce
 reliable binding affinity calculations.
 A widely used approach, the double decoupling method (DDM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gilsonStatisticalthermodynamicBasisComputation1997a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses a series of alchemical steps to estimate the absolute binding free
 energy.
 The DDM cycle consists of two physically meaningful end states (i.e bound
 and unbound states) and a series of intermediate states where the ligand
 is decoupled from the environment.
 The ligand intermolecular and intramolecular interactions are removed through
 a series of intermediate windows scaling its electrostatics and van der
 Waals (VDW) interactions to zero.
 In this way, the two molecules (receptor and ligand) are brought together
 without having to account for complicated interactions during the binding
 process and then gradually turning back on the interactions of the ligand
 allowing it to go through the physical binding process.
 Nevertheless, the DDM method is known to suffer from poor convergence without
 intramolecular interactions of the ligand.
 The ligands may collide or overlap in physical space, creating enormous
 potential energies and numerical instabilities.
 To prevent this from occurring, artificial restraints are used to keep
 the ligand from leaving the binding pocket and stop it from interacting
 with the environment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "boreschAbsoluteBindingFree2003"

.
 The use of these restraints is necessary to ensure conformations are sampled
 during the simulations and aids in good phase space overlap and faster
 convergence

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Of course, accurate sampling only helps if the molecular model, including
 the solvent environment, is accurate.
 Explicit solvents are fully atomic representations of water molecules that
 surround the solute, providing a physically detailed and generally accurate
 model and DDM was conceived with explicit solvents in mind.
 However, the inclusion of these explicit water molecules causes the simulations
 to be computationally expensive because the degrees of freedom of each
 water molecule must be calculated for every time-step 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "durrantMolecularDynamicsSimulations2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.Additionally, explicit solvent specific to ABFE calculations can cause “singular
ity events,” meaning that solute-solvent steric overlap occurs.
 The use of soft-core potentials 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "leeAlchemicalBindingFree2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is used in order to minimize or resolve the instabilities observed during
 the decoupling of the VDW parameters by shifting the inter-particle distance
 between the solute and solvent atoms.
 To avoid the extra complexity and the required computational costs of using
 explicit solvents, implicit solvents may be used.
 Implicit solvents are well suited for the DDM approach as the solvent degrees
 of freedom (DOF) are integrated out and solute-solvent steric overlap does
 not occur.
 Rather than physically representing water molecules, implicit solvent models
 provide a mean-field dielectric representation.
 Two popular pathway techniques that utilized implicit solvent models that
 have been widely exploited in free energy calculations are Molecular Mechanics/
Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized
 Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA)

) provides improved sampling at the end states while reducing the need for
 sampling in intermediate states.We aim to prove that ABFE calculations can
 be performed for diverse ligands and can be done in a fast, efficient,
 and effective manner.To this end, we created the Implicit Solvent DDM tool
 (

 ABFE calculations for virtual compound screening.The ISDDM package begins
 with a parametrized model of the complex and performs all calculations
 of the alchemical cycle, post-processing, and data analysis.Our implementation
 utilizes the open-source AmberTools molecular modeling suite to maximize
 computational throughput.

Implicit solvent models

Water plays a fundamental role in molecular association and mediates protein-lig

 Commonly, explicit water models are used, in which large number of individual

 the same theoretical level as the solute.
 While explicit models are generally a realistic representation of an water
 environment, they are computationally demanding.Moreover, water exchange
 between bulk and buried cavities can be slow and leads to inefficient sampling

 Attempting to calculate the free energy difference of ligand-host binding
 using equation (5), end-states (the ligand-bound and ligand-unbound) have
 to be similar in order to obtain reliable estimate in their free energy
 difference.
 Typically this is not the case since and the end-states have a poor space
 phase overlap leading to large uncertainties in computing the free energy
 difference.
 Therefore, the choice of intermediate states can significantly make free

 Specifically, the Hamiltonian used to calculate the energy and forces should

 In practice, the choice of the Hamiltonian is often compromise between

 Two major factors that dictate the cost of the energy and force evaluation

 In molecular mechanics (MM) description, molecules are represented by particles
 which represent atoms or groups of atoms.
 Quantum-mechanical description of the system will in general be computationally
 more demanding than classical molecular models.
 Here we focus on classical Hamiltonians that incorporate fixed point charges.
 These type of Hamiltonian are referred as to

One possibly is both WP6 and OAH having no effect is due to the fact there
 charge carbonyl atoms are solvent exposed when the ligand is bound.

A total of 5 entires use an implicit solvent model and among these methods
 we outperformed all 5 of them.
 The RRHO/COSMO and M2/PBSA are more detailed predecessor than GBSA solvent.
 Where our seemed to outperform all the implicit applicants.

Explicit solvent models which are considered a more detailed models seemed
 to varied with correlations(
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

) that range from 0 to 0.8.
 As stated before OST/TIP3P-MOD explicit solvent (

SAMPL9 challenge there were 5 rank submissions for WP6 dataset.
 The results from rank submissions were taken from another published work[cite].
 Looking at the RMSE to rank criteria of submissions, the machine learning
 method which had the smallest RMSE ~2 kcal/mol and performed the best.
 The second top performer was a extended linear interaction energy (ELIE)
 with ~2.5kcal/mol.
 The other three methods were had an average RMSE of about ~3kcal/mol.
 As we compared our RMSE with our uncorrected 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{gb}^{bind}$
\end_inset

(table 4.3) with RMSE 6.6kcal/mol having the largest deviation from the rank
 submissions.
 The trained MM/PBSA ELIE method[cite] is very similar to end-point calculations
 using an implicit solvent model GBSA.
 However this method required some system-specific training step sharing
 some similarities with ML based method and it is not fully physics based
 and is not directly transferable to other systems, especially for targets
 without known binding affinities[cite-paper].

Another published study after SAMPL9 challenge also performed end-point
 free energy study on SAMPL9 challenge data set.
 In which compute a comparison between different charge models for solutes
 such as AM1-BCC,( ) RESP-1( ), and RESP-2( ) using the GAFF2 forcefield.
 From there results RESP-1 charge performed the best among the other charge
 models but there deviation from experiment for both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA
 were still very large ~12kcal/mol.
 When comparing our RMSE to theirs we are getting better metrics but still
 not the best.

To the best of our knowledge there hasn't been any published work that benchmark
 the entire dataset of octa-acid for comparisons.
 However in SAMPL4 challenge did a smaller set of 9 guests molecules for
 blind affinity measurements for octa-acid [cite=sampl4].
 One submission in particular interest used BEDAM method [42] coupled to
 the OPLS-AA classical force field [43] and the AGBNP2 [44] continuum solvation
 model being one of the fairly accurate predictions of the SAMPL4 challenge.
 The reported average signed error was RMSE
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

=1.3 and root mean square error of all pairs of relative binding free energies
 RMSE
\begin_inset Formula $_{r}$
\end_inset

=0.9 kcal/mol.
 Also higher a one of the highest Person correlation coefficient (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.9$
\end_inset

).
 As for our results it we compute the 9 guests from the SAMPL4 challenge
 using our method will results in RMSE_o=1.3 and RMSE_r=2.0 kcal/mol and correlati
on of 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.64$
\end_inset

.
 The AGBNP2 method tuned the model to properly treat enclosed hydration
 sites has been important to achieve good accuracy.[cite-paper].
 That being said our GB model is unable to accuracy treat hydration in deep
 hydrophobic of OAH resulting in poor accuracy.

The simplicity of implicit solvent models by treating water structureless
 continuum dielectric medium provides fast estimation of solvation effects
 making them very popular for virtual screening campaigns.
 Generalize Born arguably one the faster implicit models due to making approxima
ting for calculating molecular electrostatics in solvent as describing by
 the Poisson Boltzmann equation.
 However with a number of approximations for solving polar interactions
 (electrostatics), generalize Born (GB) models causes a separation from
 the more accurate explicit solvent treatment.
 (33).
 One major approximation is the neglect of hydration asymmetry (CHA) [cite-luchk
ko paper], which contributed towards solvation free energy 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{solv}$

 on the sign of the charges of the solute.

From entire host guest dataset (figure 4.2a) using GB-OBC[cite] model we
 clearly see a bias for all charge guest ligands.
 In figure 4.2a the absolute binding estimates for positively charge guests
 being overestimates and negatively charge guests are being underestimated.
 The guest molecules having the dominate effect in binding where the host
 system having little or no effect.
 By applying a charge hydration correction on each individual charge guests
 (table4.2) which resulted in better metrics (table 4.3) across all host-guest
 system.
 This correction is suggestive that the lack of charge hydration asymmetry
 in GB is the issue.

Within AMBER contains four variants of GB models which are GB-HCT,127−129
 GB-OBC,130,131 GB-neck2,88,132 and GBNSR6.109,133.Except for GBNSR6, all
 GB models differ in how the effective Born radii are computed.
 GBNSR6 (“Numerical Surface R6 GB”) is one of newest additions to AMBER
 suite in which the effect Born radii are computed via the

 numerical integration overall the molecular surface of the solute[cite].
 GBNSR6 is known to account for hydration asymmetry and has been reported
 in predicting electrostatic solvation free energies 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{solv}$
\end_inset

[cite all papaer] are good agreement with numerical PB and explicit models
 such as TIP3P[cite all paper].
 However unlike the other GB variants models, GBNSR6 can not yet be used
 in dynamics.
 Therefore a tranferable correction towards our results will need a more
 accurate solvation model that could account for CHA.
