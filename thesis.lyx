 the most recent COVID-19 virus outbreak, the world population is constantly
 facing life-threatening events and diseases, such as cancer.

\begin_layout Itemize
Drug discovery, production, and implementation have been a huge part of
 preventing or improving these events and diseases.

\begin_layout Itemize
Modern drug development requires the screening of a vast and diverse chemical

\begin_layout Itemize
However, this process is often risky, costly, and very time-consuming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Currently, the conventional process of a potential drug candidate to reach
 the market has been estimated to take an average of 14 years, reaching
 up to 1.8 billion USD and an attrition rate as high as 96% [[paulHowImproveProdu

Results 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we use 
\begin_inset Formula $ISDDM.py$
\end_inset

 to carry out the absolute binding free energy calculations on the host-guest
 systems describe in the previous section.
 In section 4.1 we will describe the automated workflow for using 
\begin_inset Formula $ISDDM.py$
\end_inset

 how it prepares all the necessary input files, manages simulations and
 perform post-treatments.
 In section 4.2 we report on the accuracy and access the convergence of each
 step as shown in figure 1
\series bold
.
 
\series default
Finally we look at the overall scaling performance for the time required
 for the cycle to finish.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Implementation Details 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- The 
\begin_inset Formula $ISDDM.py$
\end_inset

 is a program written entirely in Python that streamline the entire workflow
 procedure of preparing, running and post-processing all the MD simulations
 for calculating the free energies, whose general workflow is shown in figure
 1
\series bold
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first step the user would proved a parameterize complex 
\begin_inset Formula $.parmameter$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $.coordinate$
\end_inset

 files which will be further explain in the user configuration sections
 4.1.1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Following the user input of complex parameter files an REMD GBSA endstate
 simulations is then executed and once completed the equilibrated binding
 conformation from the complex in state 8 is used to select and generate
 conformational and orientational restraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
At the same time, the receptor and ligand are spilt from the complex endstate
 structure to be used for all the restrained MD states 
\begin_inset Formula $2\lambda-7\lambda.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All the intermediate MD states are run simultaneously and executed in parallel
 using all the available processors that was specified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Once an intermediate MD simulation is completed this gets automatically
 pushed into post analysis to gather all the necessary state comparison
 and minimized energies.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The post-process data is then parsed into an 
\begin_inset Formula $pandas.Dateframe$
\end_inset

 which is then submitted to MBAR where the final change in BFE is calculated
 for each system.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
All steps within in the workflow are handled using the 
\begin_inset Formula $Toil$
\end_inset

 package
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vivianToilEnablesReproducible2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which is a pure Python workflow engine which allows us to create multiple
 simulations and run them simultaneously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Toil uses an API to describe the job order programmatically.
 Which allows use to create our workflow pipeline and step simulation job
 dependencies to pass there relevant information only once they are completed.

\begin_layout Standard
I think the host charge doesn’t matter here because charged atoms on the
 host are still solvent exposed when the ligand is bound.
 This is true for OAH.
 Steven, can you confirm if this is the case for WP6? However, both OAH
 and WP6 (the only charged hosts) have the worst statistics.
