Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discovery of potential drug candidates has remained a crucial endeavor
 in human history, especially in regards to science and pharmacology.
 From the influenza epidemic (1889-1890) to the most recent COVID-19 virus
 outbreak, the world population is constantly facing life-threatening events
 and diseases, such as cancer.
 Drug discovery, production, and implementation have been a huge part of
 preventing or improving these events and diseases.
 Modern drug development requires the screening of a vast and diverse chemical
 space of potential candidate compounds for FDA approval.
 This process is often risky, costly, and very time-consuming.
 Currently, the conventional process of a potential drug candidate to reach
 the market has been estimated to take an average of 14 years, reaching
 up to 1.8 billion USD and an attrition rate as high as 96% [[paulHowImproveProdu
ctivity2010]].
 Drugs that were initially deemed as potential lead candidates often show
 poor chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity
 (ADMET) properties during the clinical stages, ultimately resulting in
 their failure in clinical trials.
 Therefore, the ability to efficiently, effectively, and quickly scan a
 large chemical for potential drug candidates with desired ADMET properties
 is sought out and is of great importance in drug discovery.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploring the vast chemical space dates back to the early drug discovery
 period (before the 19th century() and the drug discovery and drug development
 period (20th century and beyond).
 It was not until the “post-genome era,” during the late 20th century, when
 the combination of molecular biology along with advances in computing robotics
 that led to the optimism that drug discovery was indeed a scalable process.
 During this time there was also a shift in drug discovery strategies that
 focused largely on high-throughput screening (HTS) which led to the identificat
ion of all drug targets and the creation of very large compound libraries
 [[jhotiHighthroughputScreeningStructurebased2013]].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this, HTS operates on the fundamental basis that assumes no prior
 knowledge of the drug binding site on the target protein.
 This led to an “irrational” drug design approach in which many pharmaceutical
 companies saw a decrease in launched drug candidates that were successful
 in the market.
 While HTS continues to be a big part of drug discovery and development,
 the lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism behind the potential
 drug species hinders the search for more promising candidates (Macarron
 et al.
 2011; Lionta et al.
 2014).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, a computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) provides a rational
 structure-based approach that can yield valuable information about intermolecul
ar interactions between protein and ligand systems as well as the binding
 affinity.
 CADD has already been successfully applied in all areas of drug discovery
 and has brought new drug compounds to the market for diverse diseases,
 including HIV-1-inhibiting drugs (atazanavir[ [robinsonBMS232632HighlyPotent200
0]] saquinavir[ [krohnNovelBindingMode1991]] and ritonavir [ [kempfABT538PotentI
nhibitor1995]]), as well as anticancer drugs, such as raltitrexed [[andersonProc
essStructureBasedDrug2003]], and antibiotics (norfloxacin [[rutenberBindingAntic
ancerDrug1996] ]).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding how ligands bind to a targeted receptor, how proteins interact
 with each other, and how proteins aggregate in the cell membrane is not
 only important for the field of biophysics but also for rational drug design.
 The use of molecular simulations on drug discovery has shown major impact
 in the past decade in response to the rapid development of computer hardware
 and performing computations in a time affordable manner.
 An example being molecular docking programs[cite] which are widely used
 to target the binding site and compute the ligand binding affinity.
 Although molecular docking provides a fast and efficient way to screen
 a large number of potential drug candidates, the accuracy of docking is
 limited by approximations used to achieve high computational speed.
 Docking programs usually treat the receptor as a rigid molecule, and the
 lack of water treatments and conformational fluctuations are handled with
 a gross approximation.

] have made great strides in estimating protein-ligand molecule binding
 free energies.
 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations implement structure-based design strategies
 and the ability to account for structural flexibility at full atomic descriptio
n.
 MD studies the physical interaction and motion of atoms based on Newtonian
 physics.
 MD are time-evolution simulations in which Newton’s laws of motions are
 continuously being updated generating configurations and trajectories of
 particles over time.
 A force field is used to describe the potential energy of a system representing
 both bonded and non-bonded (van der Waals) and electrostatic interactions.
 Several force fields commonly used in MD simulations are AMBER [

 Today, classical MD simulations of protein and ligand binding events can
 last up to a few microseconds and have a sufficient degree of accuracy.
 Despite this success, classical MD suffers from two major challenges: force
 field inaccuracy and insufficient sampling of conformational states due
 to the high computational demands that prohibit simulations greater than
 a microsecond in length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, insufficient sampling is a well-recognized problem in molecular
 simulation due to the fact there are high energy barriers separating structures
/conformations, resulting in biological systems to become trapped in deep
 energy wells of their potential energy surfaces[
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "onuchicTheoryProteinFolding2004"

\end_inset

].A direct and effective way to accelerate the thermodynamics calculations
 is to modify the potential energy surfaces by adding a bias potential to
 the Hamiltonian on the system; such techniques are called enhanced sampling[

 Additionally, endpoint methods such as molecular mechanics Poission-Boltzman
 Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born Surface
 Area (MM/GBSA) provide a cheaper way to estimate binding free energy without
 simulating the binding process [

 However, these techniques suffer from being computationally intensive,
 requiring a significant number of ensembles to converge completely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than following a physical pathway between two states, one can construct
 a non-physical pathway that involves the transformation of one system to
 another.
 These classes of unphysical pathways are referred to as alchemical transformati
on and have emerged as a useful tool for predicting free energy differences
 such as the binding of a small molecule to a receptor.
 The term “alchemical” was coined by the fact that in silico, a molecule
 can be manipulated by transforming into a noninteraction molecule where
 its respective potentials are switched off through a series of intermediate
 steps.
 Most alchemical methods include free energy perturbation (FEP) [

] and thermodynamic integration [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

].One of the earlier works conducted by Semial showcased that MD and Monte
 Carlo simulations could carry out these calculations for biomolecular systems
 [

\end_inset

].
 Alchemical methods could be classified as relative (RBFE) or absolute (ABFE)
 binding free energy calculations.
 RBFE calculations are often utilized during the hit-to-lead and lead optimizati
ons of drug discovery [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "paulHowImproveProductivity2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

].RBFE calculations yield the binding free energy of two compounds by computing
 free energy change by artificially transforming one compound to the other
 in the binding site.
 However, RBFE requires prior knowledge of the reference compound’s binding
 affinity and requires that the two compounds being prepared are structurally
 and chemically similar.
 This works well in lead optimization during the later stages of drug discovery
 when making small structural changes to the main lead candidate and comparing
 other candidates’ relative affinity [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schindlerLargeScaleAssessmentBinding2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

].
 Additionally, RBFE also requires structural similarity between molecules
 which in turn limits its capability of exploring chemical space.
 Conversely, ABFE calculations are capable of computing the standard free
 energy difference between a given compound and the receptor of interest.
 The standard free energy difference is computed from the reversible work
 of decoupling the ligand from the binding site and recoupling it with the
 bulk solvent [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "fengAbsoluteBindingFree2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

].
 Importantly, ABFE can be applied to diverse chemical space without requiring
 prior knowledge of the affinity or structural similarities of compounds
 [

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "gilsonStatisticalthermodynamicBasisComputation1997a"

\end_inset

].
 Therefore, ABFE is more suitable for the virtual screening of diverse ligands
 but suffers from the computational expense and the design (setup/running
 calculations) can be complicated to perform [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "meyBestPracticesAlchemical2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While ABFE and RBFE underlying theory is similar, the main difference between
 the two is the implemented thermodynamic cycle pathway.
 In general, performing MD simulation only at the end-states (i.e receptor-bound
 and receptor-unbound ligand) is still not computationally feasible with
 unbiased simulations due to the time scales in the binding or unbinding
 process.
 Therefore, a pathway of intermediate states is needed to allow sufficient
 space overlap between the two endstates to produce reliable binding affinity
 calculations.
 A widely used approach called the double decoupling method (DDM) [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "gilsonStatisticalthermodynamicBasisComputation1997a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

] is used to estimate the absolute binding free energy through a series
 of alchemical steps.
 The DDM cycle consists of two physically meaningful end states (i.e bound
 and unbound states) and a series of intermediate states where the ligand
 is decoupled from the environment.
 The ligand intermolecular and intramolecular interactions are removed through
 a series of intermediate windows scaling its electrostatics and van der
 Waals (VDW) interactions to zero.
 In this way, the two molecules (receptor and ligand) are brought together
 without having to account for complicated interactions during the binding
 process and then gradually turning back on the interactions of the ligand
 allowing it to go through the physical binding process.
 Nevertheless, the DDM method is known to suffer from poor convergence without
 intramolecular interactions of the ligand.
 The ligands may collide or overlap in physical space, creating enormous
 potential energies and numerical instabilities.
 To prevent this from occurring, the use of artificial restraints is proposed
 that will keep the ligand from leaving the binding pocket and stop it from
 interacting with the environment.
 The use of these restraints is necessary to ensure conformations are sampled
 during the simulations and aids in good phase space overlap and faster
 convergence [

\end_inset

].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explicit solvents are fully atomic representations of water molecules that
 surround the solute, providing a physically detailed and generally accurate
 model.
 Therefore, the DDM approach to ABFE was conceived with explicit solvents
 in mind.
 However, the inclusion of these explicit water molecules causes the simulations
 to be computationally expensive because the degrees of freedom of each
 water molecule must be calculated for every time-step [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "durrantMolecularDynamicsSimulations2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

].
 Additionally, explicit solvent specific to ABFE calculations can cause
 “singularity events,” meaning that solute-solvent steric overlap occurs.
 The use of soft-core potentials [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "leeAlchemicalBindingFree2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

] is used in order to minimize or resolve the instabilities observed during
 the decoupling of the VDW parameters by shifting the inter-particle distance
 between the solute and solvent atoms.
 To avoid the extra complexity and the required computational costs of using
 explicit solvents, implicit solvents are proposed.
 Implicit solvents are well suited for the DDM approach as the solvent degrees
 of freedom (DOF) are integrated out and solute-solvent steric overlap does
 not occur.
 Rather than physically representing water molecules, implicit solvent models
 provide a mean-field dielectric representation.
 Two popular pathway techniques that utilized implicit solvent models that
 have been widely exploited in free energy calculations are Molecular Mechanics/
Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized
 Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) [

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However, both of these methods have severe thermodynamic approximations
 [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "swansonRevisitingFreeEnergy2004"

], for example, ignoring structural changes in receptor and ligand upon
 binding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work attempts to reduce the complexity and computational cost of ABFE
 calculations by using implicit solvent models while achieving reliability
 and accuracy.
 To achieve this, we use a modified DDM cycle that uses conformational restraint
s and generalized Born (GB) solvent to enhance convergence.
 Our DDM cycle (fig.1) provides improved sampling at the end states while
 reducing the need for sampling in intermediate states.
 We aim to prove that ABFE calculations can be performed for diverse ligands
 and can be done in a fast,efficient, and effective manner.
 To this end, we created the Implicit Solvent DDM tool (ISDDM), a command
 line Python interface, to facilitate and automate the use of ABFE calculations
 for virtual compound screening.
 The ISDDM package begins with a parametrized model of the complex and performs
 all calculations of the alchemical cycle, post-processing, and data analysis.
 Our implementation utilizes the open-source AmberTools molecular modeling
 suite to maximize computational throughput.
 The ISDDM tool will be tested for accuracy by calculating the binding free
 energy of host-guest systems from SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of Modeling
 of Proteins and Ligands) challenges[44,45,48-tl].

The CSUNthesis way of adding the bibliography does not work with \SpecialChar LyX
 since
 \SpecialChar LyX
 does not think there is a bibliography and does not run bibtex.
 The bibliography and ERT below reproduce the CSUNthesis code.
